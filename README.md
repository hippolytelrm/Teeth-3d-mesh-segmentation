# 3D Teeth Scan Segmentation 


Implementation of [MeshSegNet: Deep Multi-Scale Mesh Feature Learning for Automated Labeling of Raw Dental Surface from 3D Intraoral Scanners](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8984309) [1] for automated tooth segmentation and labeling on raw dental surfaces. 
The dataset used for this project is the challenge 3DTeethSeg22 dataset (associated with MICCAI 2022) [2] and is publicly available.

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the challenge 3DTeethSeg22 dataset (associated with MICCAI 2022) [2] and is publicly available. \
It dataset contains a collection of 3D dental surface scans obtained from intraoral scanners. These scans represent the raw dental surfaces of patients and serve as the input data for the segmentation task. The dataset includes a diverse range of dental conditions and variations, capturing different teeth shapes, sizes, and occlusions. A total of 1800 3D intra-oral scans have been collected for 900 patients covering their upper and lower jaws separately.

## Install 

### Library requirements

- Pyenv 2.3.9
- Python 3.10.5    
- Poetry 1.5.1


#### Install Pyenv

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

Then, add pyenv bin directory in your shell configuration file `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)
```

Finally reload you shell 
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### Install Poetry


```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Then, add poetry's bin directory in your shell configuration file `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`

```bash
export PATH="/home/ubuntu/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Reload you shell 
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or if you are using zsh 
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Install your virtual environment
```bash
poetry install
```

## Training

Setup the paths to you training (respectively validation) data directories.

Run the training with the following command line

```bash
poetry run python src/training/train.py 
```

## Monitoring

You can monitor your training using `tensorboard` 

```bash
tensorboard --logdir "path_to_your_log_directory"
```

## TODO

- [x] Training implementation
- [x] Monitoring training
- [ ] Inference function
- [ ] Model evaluation
